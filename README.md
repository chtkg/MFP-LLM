# MFP-LLM
Overview
MFP-LLM aims to utilize large language models (LLMs) for metro passenger flow prediction. By training on large-scale datasets, this project uses advanced natural language processing techniques to predict passenger flow for different time periods and metro lines. This method provides precise forecasts, helping optimize operations and improve service efficiency for metro systems.
